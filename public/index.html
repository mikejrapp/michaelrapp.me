                Hello. My name is Mike. I am a web developer and tech enthusiast with a love of the outdoors. I have a
                little over a yearâ€™s worth of experience with Calldrip where I am currently working as the integrations
                lead. I am grateful every day to work in a challenging and rewarding field where I am able to apply my
                creative and logical aptitude.

                            As the Integrations Lead at Calldrip I have had the opportunity to build some great
                            integrations with partners like Vin Solutions here in the states as well as with some
                            companies over seas such as iX in South Africa. Not only have I learned a lot about
                            managing clean, easy to read code, I have also learned quite a bit about communication
                            and cultural sensitivity.

                            Working at CSS Corp I had the pleasure of providing VoIP support for clients such as
                            RingCentral and Vonage. During my time there I developed skills in VoIP, network and software

                            listening and time management.
